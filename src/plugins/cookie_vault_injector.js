/**
 * == Cookie Vault Injector Plugin
 *
 *   A plugin that encrypts vault device/auth keys using a dapps pubex key. The
 * vault data is then set as a HTTP cookie on the client from vault domain.
 * Which makes it only accessible by vault, and when the correct dapp is
 * launching it.
 *
 *   This method was devised to as a work around for Apple/Webkit ITP-2.0 cookie
 * restrictions. It will be in use until, or if, Webkit ever includes support
 * for LocalStorage and IndexedDB data in their ITP implementation.
 *
 *
 * == A Note on Security
 *
 *   Even though our vault server can potentially read the cookie data, as it is
 * passed by the user-agent for every HTTP request. The data is encrypted
 * against the DAPPS pubex key. Which we do not have access to, as that is
 * passed in the URI fragment to the dapp. Meaning servers only ever see the
 * encrypted form of the vault data.
