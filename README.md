# Zippie Vault
Zippie Vault is a web browser based key chain using Service Workers allowing the creattion of application specific symmetric cryptograhic keys based upon a master seed

## Application Specific Keys
Zippie Vault's main purpose is to create application specific derived symmetric keys useful for signing and encrypting arbitrary data

These are created deterministically based upon the master seed, application uri, and application generated path, for further information about the key derivation process check [BIP0032](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)

## Master Seed
The master seed is a cryptographically secure random number generated by [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/getRandomValues) used as the basis for all derived keys.

For master seed storage and transfer zippie vault works in conjunction with [amnesiacstore](https://github.com/zippiehq/amnesiacstore)

## Security
The Vault is intended to be run in a Service Worker or IFrame and is protected by the web browsers cross origin security policy. Communication with the vault is handled exclusively with postMessage calls.
